# Privacy Policy - Item Remindly

Last Updated: 2025-08-09

Item Remindly ("the App") helps you remember important personal items when leaving saved locations. We respect your privacy and collect as little data as possible.

## 1. Data We Collect
We DO NOT collect, transmit, or sell personal data to external servers. All user data (locations, item selections, preferences, subscription status) is stored locally on your device using secure storage (AsyncStorage) unless required by the App Store for purchase validation.

## 2. Location Data
Location access is used ONLY to:
- Save your custom locations (e.g., Home, Work, Gym)
- Detect when you move away from a saved location to send a reminder
- Provide background reminder functionality

Location data is never uploaded to a remote server by us.

## 3. In‑App Purchases & Subscriptions
We use App Store billing. Subscription status and purchase receipts may be validated using Apple servers. We do not store credit card information.

Auto-renewable subscriptions:
- Renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
- Can be managed in Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions.

## 4. Notifications
Notifications are used to remind you of selected items when leaving a saved location. You can disable them in system settings at any time.

## 5. Third‑Party Services
The app uses Apple frameworks and the react-native-iap library strictly for purchase handling.

## 6. Your Rights
You may delete the app to remove locally stored data. (A future update may include an in-app data reset option.)

## 7. Children
The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 8. Changes
We may update this policy. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last Updated” date.

Short Version: Your data stays on your device; we only use location to remind you about items.
